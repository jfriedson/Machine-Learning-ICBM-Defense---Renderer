# Machine Learning ICBM Defense - Renderer
 This is the renderer for the mission plans generated by the neural network.

 Written in C++ and OpenGL.

### Features
High-res (10K textures) Earth assests  
Specular, Ambient, and Diffuse lighting  
Height mapping  
Normal mapping  
Shadow mapping  
Night/Day Cycle  
LOD tesselation  
Tesselation based on the complexity of the height-map texture  

### Libraries Utilized
GLFW3 - Window creation and hardware peripherals communication  
GL3W - Expose OpenGL API  
GLM - OpenGL-purposed math library  
Freetype - Font loading and rendering  

### Known Bugs
There is a chance when the application is first started that the screen is blank or that the camera is centered around a seemingly random point.  If this happens the application must be reopened.  It is not related to the multithreading.  It seems to be a bug in the OpenGL API, possibly due to the multitude of high res textures.  I will continue investigating the cause of this issue.
